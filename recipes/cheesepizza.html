    <p><b><h2>Directions</h2></b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li> Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.</li>
        <li>Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using. </li>

    </ul>
